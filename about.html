        <h1>343 Industries is home to the Halo Universe, and to a team of talented people dedicated to creating incredible science-fiction experiences.</h1>
        <h1>We’re more than a studio, we’re a family of talented developers who are committed to making awesome experiences for our fans. To achieve that, it certainly takes a diverse team, which is why we’re home to everything from artists, engineers, designers, administrators, and inventors – but more than that, these same people are parents, pilots, painters – they’re activists, cyclists and collectors – their personal and domestic passions are as much a part of what makes this studio tick, as any detail on a resume. So those passions are woven into our social tapestry too, in our softball team, in our cook-offs, in our board game marathons, in our hiking and biking adventures -- and much, much more.</h1>
        <h1>We're charged with the past, present and future of Halo, a campaign, multiplayer and store-driven collection of awe inspiring experiences, and job one is to drive that universe forward in compelling and engaging new ways.</h1>
